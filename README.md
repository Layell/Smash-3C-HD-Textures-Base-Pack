This is the base HD texture pack for the Smash 3C Project, and contains the base HD textures for every build.

As Smash 3C has a huge amount of HD textures, this allows for easy support and access for every build.

If you don't know how to install Brawl mods, you can follow this tutorial, as you will need to add the build to Dolphin's virtual SD card: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf9gRqRe4JI

Please note: You cannot play netplay with people who do not have the exact same virtual SD card.


For textures specific to a build, be sure to download that specific build and its HD textures, and combine the folders. Put these in the "Dolphin Emulator\Load\Textures" folder.

You will need to name the folder "RSBE01" or "ID-" depending on your version of Dolphin, or how  you load the mods. "ID-" will be the one that works on the latest Dolphin build downloads.
